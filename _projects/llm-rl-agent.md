This project explores the exciting intersection of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. 

It implements an LLM-guided PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent for training in the standard Gymnasium **CartPole environment**. This approach is often used to inject higher-level reasoning or constraints into traditional RL systems.

The repository includes:
* Python code for the training logic (`src/train_agent.py`) and LLM utility functions (`src/llm_helper.py`).
* A pre-trained PPO model for the CartPole task (`ppo_cartpole_llm.zip`).

This project was created for fun to experiment with cutting-edge AI techniques!
